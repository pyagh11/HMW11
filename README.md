The objective is to build and evaluate several machine learning models to predict credit risk using data from peer-to-peer lending services. Credit risk is an inherently imbalanced classification problem (the number of good loans is much larger than the number of at-risk loans), so we will need to employ different techniques for training and evaluating models with imbalanced classes and use the imbalanced-learn and Scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using the two following techniques:

Resampling
Ensemble Learning
